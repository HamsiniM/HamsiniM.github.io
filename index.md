Complex numbers are numbers with a *real component* and an *imaginary component*, in the form \\(a+bi\\), where a and b are **real numbers** and \\(i\\) is the **imaginary unit**.

An extended explaination of complex numbers can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number).

It can be helpful to visualize compelx numbers on the complex plane:

Complex numbers can also be represented in polar form as below:

To understand how the polar form is derived, check out this video:

**Statement:** My mini project is to craft a research paper that summarizes the impact of quantum computing on financial security, with a primary focus on cryptography as the underlying framework for analysis. The research will examine how quantum advances threaten current cryptographic systems and explore post-quantum solutions tailored for financial applications.

**Background:**

***Motivation:*** I’ve always been drawn to interdisciplinary topics, and the intersection of quantum computing, cryptography, and finance presents a rare opportunity to explore how theoretical concepts can have practical consequences in the fintech sector.

***Video(Post-Quantum Cryptography):***
