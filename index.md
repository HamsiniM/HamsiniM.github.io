**Statement:** My mini project is to craft a research paper that summarizes the impact of quantum computing on financial security, with a primary focus on cryptography as the underlying framework for analysis. The research will examine how quantum advances threaten current cryptographic systems and explore post-quantum solutions tailored for financial applications.

**Background:**

***Motivation:*** I’ve always been drawn to interdisciplinary topics, and the intersection of quantum computing, cryptography, and finance presents a rare opportunity to explore how theoretical concepts can have practical consequences in the fintech sector.
